/**
 * Used-Nonce Registry
 *
 * Persists every derived signing nonce that has been used for an attestation
 * and refuses to let the same nonce material be reused.
 *
 * Reusing a BIP-340 nonce k across two different signatures leaks the oracle
 * private key (x = (s1 - s2) / (e1 - e2)). The derivation in
 * attestation-engine.ts binds the eventId into the derivation path, but the
 * derivation itself is deterministic: if it were ever weakened, reset, or
 * collided, this registry is the fail-closed backstop.
 *
 * Policy: a signing nonce k may only ever sign one (eventId, messageHash) pair.
 * The registry identifies k by its public point R (`nonceId`). Reuse for a
 * DIFFERENT eventId - or for a different message under the same eventId - is
 * refused. Identical (eventId, messageHash) may be signed again: the signature is
 * then identical and reveals nothing new.
 *
 * Guarantees, each enforced by the named function:
 *
 * 1. ONE WRITER PER REGISTRY FILE (acquireLock). The registry path is
 *    canonicalized with realpath BEFORE the lock path `<registry>.lock` is
 *    derived, so symlinked and parent-directory spellings of one file share one
 *    lock. The lock is an O_EXCL create taken once, in the constructor, and held
 *    through an open file descriptor until close(). A second instance - in this
 *    process or another - fails at construction. Before every write the lock is
 *    re-verified by inode identity (assertLockHeld: fstat of the held descriptor
 *    against lstat of the lock path); the descriptor is kept open so that the
 *    inode number cannot be recycled while this instance holds it.
 *
 * 2. NO AUTOMATIC TAKEOVER. This code never reclaims an existing lock, whatever
 *    it contains (pid, hostname, age). Node exposes no kernel file lock
 *    (flock/fcntl) in its standard library, and pid, hostname or mtime checks
 *    cannot prove that a writer is dead, so any automatic reclaim races with a
 *    live writer. A lock left by a crashed process therefore blocks startup until
 *    an operator confirms that no process uses the registry and removes the lock
 *    file. The error message says exactly that. Recovery does not lose history:
 *    once the lock is cleared, the anchor (guarantee 4) is checked on every start.
 *
 * 3. ALIASING IS REFUSED (assertSingleLink). The registry must be a regular file
 *    with exactly one hard link. A second hard link would give the other name a
 *    stale copy and a second, independent lock path. Checked on load and again
 *    before each commit. A symlink that resolves to the registry is handled by
 *    guarantee 1.
 *
 * 4. HISTORY IS A CHAINED LOG WITH AN ANCHOR (readVerifiedLog, load, save). Records
 *    are appended to a digest chain: chain[i] = sha256(chain[i-1] || sha256(nonceId
 *    || eventId || messageHash)). The anchor file `<registry>.anchor` records the
 *    chain tip last committed. On start, the anchor must equal the tip of the
 *    verified log, or be exactly one entry behind it. One entry behind means the
 *    process stopped after committing the log and before updating the anchor; that
 *    entry is accepted and the anchor is advanced. Two or more entries ahead of the
 *    anchor is refused, because no crash can produce it. The anchor is caught up
 *    before the next log commit, so a failed anchor write cannot let the log run
 *    ahead in the same process either. A log that is shorter than the anchor, or
 *    diverges from it, is refused. A registry whose anchor is missing while the log
 *    has records is also refused. Both files are read through one descriptor
 *    opened with O_NOFOLLOW, and must be regular single-link files.
 *
 * 5. DURABLE COMMITS (replaceFileDurably). The log is committed by writing a
 *    temporary file, fsyncing it, renaming it over the registry, and fsyncing the
 *    directory. A nonce is never signed unless save() returned normally, which
 *    requires the log rename and the anchor rename to have both completed and
 *    their directory fsyncs to have succeeded. The rename is the point where the
 *    in-memory state records the new log tip (the file is then on disk, even if
 *    the directory fsync that follows fails). The anchor is marked stale at that
 *    point, and it is caught up before any further log commit. A record that a
 *    failed commit left pending is committed before a new record is added, so each
 *    log commit writes at most one entry. So after any failed commit the log is at
 *    most one entry ahead of the anchor, and a retry of a recorded nonce re-commits
 *    the anchor before it answers.
 *
 * LIMITS (not enforced here):
 *  - The anchor is unkeyed. Whoever can write the registry directory can rewrite
 *    the log and the anchor together, or delete both, and reset the history. The
 *    anchor only detects truncation that leaves it in place. Mitigation is
 *    operational: restrict the directory to the signer, and back up the anchor.
 *  - The anchor is written after the log, so a crash between the two leaves an
 *    anchor one commit behind. Until the next start advances it, truncating
 *    exactly that last commit is indistinguishable from a crash. This needs
 *    write access to the registry directory, which the limit above already
 *    covers.
 *  - Durability relies on POSIX rename and directory fsync semantics. Platforms
 *    where the directory cannot be fsynced cannot host a registry.
 *  - Upgrading from a version with no anchor file: the start is refused. The
 *    error message gives the anchor format to create by hand from the log tip.
 *
 * 6. NO IN-MEMORY-ONLY MODE OUTSIDE DEVELOPMENT. `persistPath: null` is only
 *    accepted with an explicit `allowInMemory: true` opt-in (the attestation
 *    engine only grants it in development mode on non-mainnet networks).
 *
 * 7. THE LOCK IS RELEASED ON EVERY CLEAN EXIT (installShutdownHooks). The lock is
 *    removed by close(), by process 'exit', and by SIGINT/SIGTERM when this module
 *    is the only listener for that signal (the handler then re-raises the signal
 *    with default disposition). Releasing is safe at those points because every
 *    commit is synchronous: when a hook runs, nothing is half-committed and no
 *    further signature can be produced by this process. A process that is
 *    SIGKILLed, OOM-killed or power-cut keeps its lock (guarantee 2).
 *
 * 8. NO SECRET IN THE LOG. `nonceId` is the public nonce point R that the oracle
 *    announces for an (event, index). The registry must never receive the base
 *    point P of the derived nonce key: the signing nonce is k = oracleKey +
 *    deriveNonceTweak(P, eventId), so P and one published signature reveal the
 *    oracle key (see deriveSigningNonce in attestation-engine.ts). Logs in format
 *    version 2, which stored P, are refused at startup. Their records cannot be
 *    migrated, because the registry does not hold the oracle key to recompute R,
 *    and any published attestation for those events already exposes the oracle
 *    key.
 *
 * NOT ENFORCED:
 *  - Network filesystems (NFS, SMB, FUSE-remote) are unsupported. O_EXCL
 *    exclusivity, rename atomicity and directory fsync are not guaranteed across
 *    clients there, so two hosts can both acquire the lock.
 *  - Keyed anchor (declined). Keying the anchor with an HMAC would stop forging a
 *    new history, but it would have to use a secret held beside the log, so
 *    whoever can read it can also forge it. It cannot stop rollback to an older
 *    consistent snapshot of the log and anchor together. Only an external
 *    monotonic counter can, and this module does not have one.
