/**
 * Round-10 regression tests, maturity gate (Clone B, regression review).
 *
 *  B1  a caller-edited announcement cannot pass the maturity gate: the gate reads
 *      maturityTime from the object passed in, so the object must carry this engine's
 *      signature over the canonical message (which covers maturityTime) before any
 *      signing. Before this round a past maturity on a forged copy was signed, which
 *      disclosed the outcome early and consumed the event's nonce.
 *  B2  a forged announcement with a zero, NaN or unsafe maturity is refused the same way.
